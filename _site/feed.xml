kinds of large herbaceous flowering plants in the genus Musa.</p>

<p>In some countries, bananas used for cooking may be called “plantains”,
distinguishing them from dessert bananas. The fruit is variable in size,
color, and firmness, but is usually elongated and curved, with soft
flesh rich in starch covered with a rind, which may be green, yellow,
red, purple, or brown when ripe.</p>]]></content><author><name>jill</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A banana is an edible fruit – botanically a berry – produced by several kinds of large herbaceous flowering plants in the genus Musa.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Apples</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/pages0/2024/09/12/apples.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Apples" /><published>2024-09-12T00:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2024-09-12T00:00:00+08:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/pages0/2024/09/12/apples</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/pages0/2024/09/12/apples.html"><![CDATA[<p>An apple is a sweet, edible fruit produced by an apple tree.</p>

<p>Apple trees are cultivated worldwide, and are the most widely grown
species in the genus Malus. The tree originated in Central Asia, where
its wild ancestor, Malus sieversii, is still found today. Apples have
been grown for thousands of years in Asia and Europe, and were brought
to North America by European colonists.</p>]]></content><author><name>jill</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[An apple is a sweet, edible fruit produced by an apple tree.]]></summary></entry></feed>
